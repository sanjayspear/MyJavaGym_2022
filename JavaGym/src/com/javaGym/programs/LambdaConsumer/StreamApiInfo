StreamApiInfo:

==> 1. Stream API is used to process collections of objects.
    2. Stream is a sequence of objects that supports various methods which can be pipelined to produce the desired result.
    3. Stream is not a data structure. Instead, it takes input from the Collections, Arrays, I/O Channels.
    4. Streams don't change the original data structures, they only provide the result as per the pipelined methods.
