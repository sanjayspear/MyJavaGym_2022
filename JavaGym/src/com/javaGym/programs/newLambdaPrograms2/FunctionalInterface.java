		//       this is the type of the interface that we can use it for declaring lambda types.
		
		// Note: If any interface contains more than one abstract method then it is no longer the functional interface.
		
		// Note: In java 8 we have the specific marker to define the interface as the functional interface.
		
		//       Till java 7, java interfaces are purely abstract. However, Java 8 and later versions, allows us to define concrete methods 
		//       along with abstract method. Now in java 8 we can have method implemented in the interface itself.
